# Getting Started with Create React App

Here is a small project created using React.js that uses the GitHub Open API to perform a search by username and retrieve basic information such as:

-Profile creation date
-Username
-Location
-Workspace
-Repositories
-Followers
-Following

My project corresponds to a front-end mentor project, but unfortunately, I haven't implemented the responsive design yet.




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
